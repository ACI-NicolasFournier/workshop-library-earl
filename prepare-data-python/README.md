# Prepare your data using Python and VS Code

## Module Source

[Use a Docker container as a development environment with Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-docker-container-dev-env-vs-code/?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella)

## Goals

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Python, and popular libraries like NumPy and pandas, to manipulate and clean data to prepare it for analysis.

| **Goal**              | Description                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What will you learn**       | How to find information about, clean, and prepare data that's stored in a pandas DataFrame.                                       |
| **What you'll need**          | [Visual Studio Code environment set up to run Python and Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-data-science/1-introduction?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella) |
| **Duration**                  | 1 hr 20 min                                                                |

## What students will learn

Say you want to perform some analysis on a dataset that you find interesting -- like the [squirrel population of Central Park](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/), or [various types of French cheese](https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/french-cheese-detection). The first thing you'll need to do with any dataset is to clean it up. Many datasets have missing information, or won't be formatted in the exact way you'd like. In this workshop, you will learn how to use data science libraries to prepare your data for analysis and visualization.

## Introduction

In this section, you'll review an [introduction]
(https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/data-manipulate-clean/1-introduction?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella) and make sure that your data science environment is set up correctly before continuing on to the next part of the workshop.

## Explore DataFrame information

Next, you will learn how to use Python libraries to [explore an iconic dataset](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/data-manipulate-clean/2-explore-dataframes?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella). You will be able to understand how to use pandas DataFrames to get an immediate idea about the size, shape, and content of a particular dataset. 

## Work with missing data

Now that you know how to get an overall sense of the dataset you are working with, you will learn [how to identify and  deal with missing values](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/data-manipulate-clean/3-missing-data?WT.mc_id=academic-55190-ornella).
