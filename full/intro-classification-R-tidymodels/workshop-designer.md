# Introduction to classification models by using R and Tidymodels 

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

1. Students will be skilled at:
- Understanding what is classification and when to use a classification model
- Training and evaluating regression models using the Tidymodels framework
1. Students will be able to independently use their learning to:
- Experimenting with different classification models 
- Tuning models hyperparameters

## Stage 2: Evidence
 
- Hands-on challenge on wine records dataset, following [Challenge-Classification.ipynb](./solution/Challenge-Classification.ipynb) notebook
- Knowledge check quiz 

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

- Introduction
- Train and evaluate a classification model
- Experimenting with models
- Challenge - Create a classification model using Tidymodels
- Knowledge check
