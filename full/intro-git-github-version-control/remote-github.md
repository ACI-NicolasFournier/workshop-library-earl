# Part 2: Working with Remotes

While working locally may seem enough for some people sometimes we need to collaborate with others so, this is where a remote place to store our code comes into place, and our remote is GitHub a cloud platform used to share code with others and collaborate on projects.

## Creating a GitHub Repository

## Cloning a Git Repository Locally
$ git clone <path-to-repository-to-clone>

This command:
- takes the path to an existing repository
- by default will create a directory with the same name as the repository 
that's being cloned
- can be given a second argument that will be used as the name of the 
directory
- will create the new repository inside of the current working directory
