# Part 2: Working with Remotes

## Creating a GitHub Repository

## Cloneing a Git Repository Locally
$ git clone <path-to-repository-to-clone>

This command:
• takes the path to an existing repository
• by default will create a directory with the same name as the repository 
that's being cloned
• can be given a second argument that will be used as the name of the 
directory
• will create the new repository inside of the current working directory
