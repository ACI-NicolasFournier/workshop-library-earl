## What you will learn

You're a web developer and you've produced files that makes out a web app. Typically a web app consists of  HTML, JavaScript or CSS files and can be produced by manually creating all the files or use a framework to do so.

You'd love pushing those files to Azure so you can share them as a website with your peers.

In this workshop, you'll learn to:

- Use Azure Static web apps service.
- Deploy a web app to Azure using said service.

## Introduction to Azure static web apps service

Read about the service [in this introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/publish-app-service-static-web-app-api/1-introduction?pivots=angular).

## Create a web app

Before you can deploy the app to Azure, you need to take the following steps:

- Create a repo from a template
- Run the app locally and view it via a Browser.

[Let's create the repo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/publish-app-service-static-web-app-api/2-exercise-get-started?pivots=angular)!

## Plan your Azure static app

To deploy your app on Azure, you need to provision an Azure static apps resource. Said resource needs a few fields to be filled in. Your GitHub repo has a concept called actions that's capable of doing many things like testing code, deploying it and more. GitHub actions is the underlying technology Azure static apps rely on to deploy your app to the cloud.

Learn more about Azure static app and its fields as well as GitHub actions. [Read more about the fields here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/publish-app-service-static-web-app-api/3-static-web-apps?pivots=angular)

## Create the Azure static app

To simplify your deployment to Azure, you can use a Visual Studio Code extension released by the Azure Static apps team. By using the extension, it will create the needed cloud resources the Azure static app needs as well as deploy your app. Read more about [creating the app here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/publish-app-service-static-web-app-api/4-exercise-static-web-apps?pivots=angular)
